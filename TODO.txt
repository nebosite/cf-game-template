    [ ] Rename files and remove the "Testorama" prefix so that no files need renaming when
        creating new games from this template
    [ ] Use create-react-app to fill in the root directory with items needed 
        to compile as standalone
    [ ] link to frontend to get the testLobby
    [ ] Configure to run the testlobby with 'npm start'
    [ ] Remove Testorama from frontend and instead include this template project 
        as a submodule so it can be worked on in parallel with frontend code
    [ ] Edit the Readme to explain how to turn this template into a custom game project
        [ ] Maybe create a script to do this automagically
            - The script could live in the frontend project and just copy generically from github to create a new game?

Example manifest:
{
    client: {
        package: "@clusterfun/client",
        version: "^2.0.0"
    },
    games: [
        {
            package: "@mycfgames/foomius",
            version: "^3.0.0",
            tags: "debug, alpha"
        },
        {
            package: "@mycfgames/lexible",
            version: "^1.0.0",
            tags: "release"
        }
    ]
}
